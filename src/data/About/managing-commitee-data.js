    'It was a long cherished dream of Late Maj. S.N. Bhalla and Mrs. Ritu Bhalla to start a school in the Kumaun Region to provide quality education at affordable price to the people of this region. With this vision they put their shoulders to the wheel to sow the seed of LITTLE SCHOLARS in April 1983. They were assisted in this onerous task by some very dedicated and diligent teachers who helped them in nourishing the seed into a lofty banyan and a citadel of learning.',
