      "In the Junior Section, depending upon the season, students are required to train in a minimum of two sports. They undergo training in Football, Cricket, Athletics, Basketball, Tennis, Squash, Kho-Kho, Table Tennis and Swimming. The students are encouraged to specialize in the sport according to their inclination and also based on the suggestions of the expert Coaches for at least one whole year. Many of them stay specialised with that sport and acquire special skills. However, the students are encouraged to play inter-house tournaments and participate in other sports, to promote all-rounder sportsmen. This emphasis also instils team spirit skills for life beyond the school days, and a wider appreciation of sport in general. The marathon is a mandatory event and is one of the key resources for the assessment of student health and wellbeing. Every student on an average is required to play for an hour of sports every day. Further, the school has a mission that every student must be able to swim.",
      "The students regularly represent National, State, District, Inter School and CBSE tournaments. Many national level sportsmen have emerged from the school. Apart from outdoor sports, the students are encouraged to play cerebral games like Chess.",
