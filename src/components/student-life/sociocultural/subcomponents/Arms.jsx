                "The journey to becoming an Inclusive School may be long and challenging at times, but ultimately this journey can strengthen a school community and benefit ALL children. Inclusion does not simply mean the placement of students with disabilities in general education classes. This process must incorporate fundamental change in the way a school community supports and addresses the individual needs of each child. In 2018, Little Scholars incorporated The open ARMS project after a pilot project carried out by their own students in collaboration with JSR Indu Samiti; a Residential School for the Specially Abled of creating a space within its curriculum planner which has now collaborated with other NGOâ€™s and schools. As such, effective models of inclusive education not only benefit students with disabilities, but also create an environment in which every student; including those who do not have disabilities, has the opportunity to flourish.",
                "One of the most important principles of inclusive education is that no two learners are alike, and so inclusive schools place great importance on creating opportunities for students to learn and be assessed in a variety of ways. Teachers therefore must consider a wide range of learning modalities (visual, auditory, kinaesthetic, etc.) in designing instruction and help diversify the educational experience of the students.",
